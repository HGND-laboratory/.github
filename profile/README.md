# 🧬 Human Genetics of Neurological Disorders

Research unit at IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele (Milan, Italy), within the Division of Neuro-Science (DNS).
We study the **genetic and multi-omics architecture of neurological disorders**, with a primary focus on multiple sclerosis (MS) and CNS inflammatory diseases.

## 👥 Who We Are

A multidisciplinary team of neurologists, biologists, and bioinformaticians working alongside a biobank of 4,000+ patients with CNS inflammatory disorders.
Led by **Federica Esposito, MD, PhD** — neurologist and computational biologist integrating clinical neurology with advanced genomics and data science.

## 🔬 Research Focus

We investigate:

* 🧬 Genetic susceptibility & disease risk
* 🧩 Clinical heterogeneity & endophenotypes
* 📈 Disease activity & progression
* 💊 Treatment response
* 🌍 Environmental determinants

Our approaches include:

* Whole genome & mitochondrial analysis
* Transcriptomics, methylomics & immunosequencing
* Single-cell technologies
* Systems biology & AI-driven modeling

🎯 **Goal:** Translate multi-omics data into precision medicine for neurology.

## 💻 Our GitHub for HGND-Laboratory 

Here we share:

* GWAS and population genetics workflows
* scRNA-seq & multi-omics pipelines
* Reproducible bioinformatics tools
* Statistical and AI-based modeling frameworks

We are committed to **open science, reproducibility, and collaboration**.
